# WordCounter

To use:
Open the TextFileReader project, within AppMain.java change FILEPATH to point to your test text file.

Run AppMain.java

Unit tests can be ran from TextFileReaderTest.java

Assumptions made: My definition of a word in this context is quite basic, based on the example given it is a white space seperated string with trailing punctuation removed.
